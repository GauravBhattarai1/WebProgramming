          <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p> 
            CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.
The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.
Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.
Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.
It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.
